# Counter App

This project is a simple Counter application developed with React. It is designed to help users learn and practice key React concepts such as managing states and implementing two-way data binding. The app allows users to:

- **Increment** and **decrement** the counter value.
- **Reset** the counter to its initial value.

## Key Skills and Concepts Learned:
- `useState` for managing state in functional components.
- Two-way binding for syncing the state with the UI.
- Event handling for updating and resetting the counter value.

This project provides a solid foundation for beginners looking to understand how to manage and interact with state in React applications.
